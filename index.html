                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am a first-year student in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I am interested in solving key problems in mathematics and engineering: grand or mundane, novel or classic. Read more below to find out about the issues I find important.

                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    A motif that has dominated much of my life is problem solving. I began contest math and competitive programming at ages 9 and 12, 
                    respectively. My competitive career eventually found moderate success with awards in various contests such as the CCO, USAMO, and APMO. 
                    Eventually, these hobbies that began as simply ways to supplement my learning has evolved into a lifelong interest in
                    tackling the hardest problems around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my formative years, I have continously sought out ways to challenge myself and spur my growth. These ventures include
                    attending Toronto's premiere science and math program, TOPS; a research experience at Scholar Launch; and attending Canada's top-ranking 
                    engineering program at UWaterloo.

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <hr>
                <b>Graph Theory</b>
                <p>
                    Graph theory is an interesting intersection of computer science and combinatorics, the area of math I'm strongest in. Whether by exposure or
                    innate affinity, I've found the solutions graph theory problems to be particularly elegant. Tarjan's Algorithm for finding strongly connected 
                    components has stuck with me particularly vividly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I am not super invested in P vs. NP, I personally believe that the NP-complete version of the Travelling Salesman Problem does not
                    have a polynomial-time solution, which would imply that P is not equal to NP. Though, of course, I cannot prove this.
                </p>
                <b>Machine Learning</b>
                <p>
                    Machine learning has taken the world by storm, and shows seemingly unlimited potential in its ability to scour the internet for human knowledge 
                    and make accurate predictions in outwardly unpredictable systems. However, Cathy O'Neil's <i>Weapons of Math Destruction</i>—albeit lacking in 
                    convincing details, the book contains many noteworthy examples—and the more recent allegations against UnitedHealthcare on their misuse of 
                    machine learning algorithms have shown that much of the field is grossly under-regulated. Not only does the legislation need to catch up, more 
                    transparent machine learning models and concrete mathematical metrics must be developed in order to demand accountability.
